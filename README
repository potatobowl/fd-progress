fd-progress

inspired by http://blog.ksplice.com/2011/01/solving-problems-with-proc/ by keegan

Requires: python 2.5+ and dialog (debian/ubuntu: apt-get install dialog)

This python script will try to find running processes that has any interesting file descriptors (fd's),
and let the user select one of them, and then apply a progress bar on the selected fd.

Example:
Say you start a cp operation or similar that will take a long time to execute.
Since you might forgot to include some kind of progress feedback, you can use
this script to hook onto the file descriptor and get a fancy progress bar.

run example:
./fd-progress

will output something like (will differ plenty on your computer):
Found 2 interesting processes.
Which file are you reading from? Select the correct fd number.

PID: 23644
cmd: /usr/bin/python ./fdread.py
->[0] /home/jqs/Documents/C++/large.pdf
->[1] /home/jqs/tmpfd

PID: 23049
cmd: vim README
->[2] /home/jqs/Dev/fd-progress/.README.swp

Select fd: 

As you can see, the cmd running on pid 23644 is a script that will copy a file for me quite slowly,
and I know the large.pdf is the source file and tmpfd is the destination, so in this case I would
want to know the read position in the source file, and hence will 0 and press ENTER.

This should hopefully start displaying a progress bar using `dialog --gauge` and show the operation progress.
